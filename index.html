					<div class="title"><h2>What is Hack Month?</h2></div>
					<p>Hack Month is an open-source, collaborative event inspired by the popular writing event "<a href="http://www.nanowrimo.org/">NaNoWriMo</a>". NaNoWriMo is a national event encouraging participants to reach a goal of 50,000 words in 30 days. Hack Month is an attempt to achieve a similar goal. We aim to bring programmers, engineers, designers, and hackers to together to start and finish their own individual projects in one month.</p>

					<p>The end goal is simple: create a prototype. It won't be the cleanest code or the prettiest machine, but it will work.</p>

					<p>This will be a great opportunity for people interested in coding to dive right in and become programmers. Likewise, for aspiring engineers, this is the time to get an Arduino and create something fun in a month. For programmers with prior experience, it's a fine opportunity to break into an unfamiliar language like Clojure or Objective-C. For hackers and engineers, create something out of the ordinary, just for the sake of it.</p>

					<p>Want to build a video game in Python? Here's your motivation. How about developing your startup idea? Now or never. Build a prototype of a lamp that dims automatically with reduced sunlight or a first attempt at the meshnet (<a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/darknetplan">hint, hint</a>).</p>

					<p>The daily goal for NaNoWriMo is to write about 1,667 words, and this can range between an hour to three hours for most people. We're still looking for ways to objectively measure progress, but it may turn out that everyone will set individual interim goals that would take an equivalent amount of time.</p>

					<p>Hack Month 2012 is currently planned for August 2012. All who participate are welcome to share their creations, or at least detail what they created to the rest of the community.</p>
